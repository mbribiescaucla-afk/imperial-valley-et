# Imperial Valley ET: Open Science Code Library

> A curated, reproducible codebase for an ongoing project in Californiaâ€™s Imperial Valley.  
> Goal: keep a clean, modular, and documented library of code for each step of the project.

## Project scope

This repository will track end-to-end workflows for:
1. **Acreage of the top 10 crops** (Python)
2. **Evapotranspiration (ET)** workflows (placeholder
