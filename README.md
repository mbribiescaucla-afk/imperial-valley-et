# Imperial Valley ET — Open Science Code Library

> A curated, reproducible Python codebase for an ongoing project in California’s Imperial Valley.  
> This repository aims to keep all scripts, data workflows, and documentation organized by project step. 
## Project Overview

The project focuses on:
1. **Acreage of the top 10 crops** (Python code).
2. **Evapotranspiration (ET)** workflows (to be developed later).

The emphasis is on:
- **Reproducibility** — code and instructions to replicate results.
- **Open Science practices** — public sharing of scripts and methodology.
- **Clean structure** — clear separation between code, data, and outputs.
